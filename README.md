# Coding Language Selector

### Created by Sarah Gilbert

## Description

##### This webpage was created to help the user find out what coding language best suites them, in the form of a fun quiz! The purpose of this project was to incorperate the skills that I have learned in the last week, such as the use of JavaScript and JQuery. I was able to design the page so the user would have multiple questions they would have to answer, using the a drop down menu to display the 4 options/answers they can choose from. Once all questions are answered, you can click the button at the bottom of the screen. At that point 1 of 4 options will appear along with a link to learn more about that coding language.  I was able to set up the html and JavaScript to add up the values from each answer, so depending on the sequence of answers you choose, your result could always differ from the time before. While looking through the code of this project you will find the usage of multiple images and gifs, typography styles, multiple box models, the use of show/hide and an examples of branching.
